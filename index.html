Wish you a very Happy Birthday, Ju Ju ❤✨🫂
You are always so special to me, Thangoo. I just want you to be happy — with or without me. The universe will surely bless you with a beautiful life ✨🙌. I’ll always pray for your happiness, da.

Remember, I’ll always be there for you — whenever you need me, you can come to me. You made me smile, you made me cry, you made me feel broken, and yet you also made me feel special 😊. I was truly happy with you.

If I could, I’d delete the part of our story where I fell. I’m happy now, daa — but if you had stayed in my life completely, it would’ve been even more beautiful. Maybe I just don’t have that much luck 🫠.

I lived a beautiful, imaginary life with you ❤. I’ve never felt this way for anyone else, and I believe someday all these feelings will settle. I’ll never forget you — you’ll always be a special part of my life.

You might say we never met even once, and yes, that’s true. But the comfort and care you gave me — I loved that, daa ☺. I’ll never force you to be with me. Some day I may become someone else’s “property,” and you’ll soon belong to your gorgeous girlfriend — the one you love the most in this world 🌎❤‍🩹.

My husband will come soon 🥺, so I won’t disturb you or ask you to love me again. I never had a good family, friends, or siblings — I’ve always been lonely 🙁. Everyone has hurt me in some way, and I’ve never really been pampered 😔. My mother loves me a lot, but… you already know everything. I’m okay only, daa.

Still, I have 2 more years to go. Let you be the first and last person I chose to love ❤. From now, I’ll let my family choose my partner — because whenever I choose, it turns out wrong, just like us 🤕.

I might wait for another 3–4 years, but forgetting those one-month snd night talks will be really hard for me 🥲. Maybe it’s easy for you, but not for me. I never got my father’s love 💔, and since childhood, I’ve always been that lonely person 😔. But it’s okay — everything is my karma.

Once again, wish you a very Happy Birthday, dear 🥰🫂
So, where’s the party and treat, huh? 🥳
Cheers 🍻 to your 22 years, Thangoo!
Love you so much 💗 Miss you so much 🫂🤧
